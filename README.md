# TestHTML

A html testing playground organized by topic in the html tutorial here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML

Workable code is written on each topic to demonstrate use of html in the topic area.

## Installation

A html file can be opened on any modern browser. However, certain features require the file to be uploaded to a server, and for that purpose, WinNMP was used to create a local virtual server. Atom was used as text editor.
